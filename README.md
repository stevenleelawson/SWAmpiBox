## SWapiBox

A react project by Steven Lee Lawson

## Installation

After cloning, please run `npm-install` in your terminal
Then run `npm start` to see amazing Star Wars factoids!

## Description

This project was practice perfecting building React components that populate data on the page by making fetch calls to the Star Wars API. Cards on the page are dynamically populated by different calls for people, vehicles, and planets. They can be 'favorited' as well as 'un-favorited', and by clicking on the favorites button, the user can see all cards that were selected. Neat!
